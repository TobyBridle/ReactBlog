# How the Filter System currently works

At the moment, since this is just a static page, GraphQL retrieves a list of articles & their metadata.
This metadata contains lots of useful information, but what we use for the filtering is `rank` & `following`. The `rank` property shows how high on the **Popular** filter the article should be, and `following` just indicates that the article should be on the **Following** filter.

<CodeHighlight language="js" content={`
  const {
    allMdx: { nodes }, // Map the value of \`allMdx\` to the variable \`nodes\`
  } = useStaticQuery(BlogPostsMetaData);
\n
  // \`postCount\` was defined in the scope of the component\n
  const pages = {
    following: nodes
      .filter((post) => post.frontmatter.following !== "none")
      .slice(0, postCount),
    popular: nodes
      .filter((post) => post.frontmatter.rank > 0)
      .sort((rank, rankAsc) => rank.frontmatter.rank - rankAsc.frontmatter.rank)
      .slice(0, postCount),
  };\n
  const [activeFilter] = useRecoilState(FilterAtom);
`} />

<Label text="The Filter in JS" />

As you can see in the snippet above, a GraphQL query is made to retrieve the necessary data about each blog post. The query returns an array of records which are then checked for the properties. Posts with the **following** property, but not a **rank**, are placed into the **following** key for `pages` (`pages['following']`). Posts with a rank, are placed into the **popular** key for `pages` (`pages['popular']`).
Depending on the state of `activeFilter`, the page will render one of the two (either `pages['following']` or `pages['popular']`).


# How this could be done using a Server

We could use a similar concept as already shown; however, rather than manually needing to update the frontmatter of each blog page - we could use GraphQL [**mutations**](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/). Mutations are used to update the value of a field on the server. We could combine a `useEffect` and a mutation regarding the change of a field named `hits`.
Then, when we are rendering the articles, we can sort by `hits` in descending order for the **Popular** filter.
