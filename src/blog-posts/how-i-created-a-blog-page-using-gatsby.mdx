# The Initial Idea

I knew I needed some (more) projects to add to my portfolio, since the existing ones were not
showcasing my skills. I needed something that, though giving me more experience & confidence in React,
would not consume all of my freetime (it was the Christmas holidays - time for relaxing). I went through my Figma and found a design
for a college project ([BHASVIC Magazine](https://b-mag.bhasvic.ac.uk/404)) that I hadn't ended up using. It matched my criteria, and was easy enough to code.

# A Timeline of Development

> Though this project was not **too** time consuming, I still had quite a few hiccups.
> For the first few hours, development was going swimmingly. The theme switching was working - and the components such as the `Navbar` and `PageMeta` were coming along nicely; however, I encountered a problem that I had overlooked: hosting. At the time, I was using `create-react-app` to bundle my code. It did not provide the features that I needed. This is when I looked to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). I ported all of my Components from my `create-react-app` project over to Gatsby - also switching from [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/). I found Recoil much simpler to use, and it turns out it's also much faster (`O(1)` rather than `O(n)`).

MDX > Vanilla Markdown. So that we can have react elements in our blog posts, we had to switch from just using traditional markdown to something known as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). In MDX, we can easily embed react elements with the same syntax that we would in a normal project. For example, to add this image below, we can use

<CodeHighlight language="js" content={`
    import BlockImage from "../components/MDX/BlockImage.js"
    \n
    /*
    Lots of very cool blog content
    */
    \n
    <BlockImage src="https://example.com/example.png" alt="Example Image" title="Example Image" />
`} />

<BlockImage src="http://localhost:8000/assets/Banners/how-i-created-a-blog-using-gatsby.svg" />

This is very useful as it means we can write blog posts easily using the Markdown format, but do not have to deal with its restrictions. It'll provide us with a lot more customisation that we didn't use to have, yet doesn't come with any large drawbacks.

I managed to do a lot on this day. Most notably:
- Finishing Bookmarks (Used Recoil and Recoil-Persist)
- Finishing all Navigation Pages

**Bookmarks**

You can test out the bookmarks by clicking on an article and clicking "Bookmark?" in the bottom right. Go back to [Explore](/explore) and click on the Bookmarks button. There, you'll be able to view all of your bookmarked articles.
You may have also noticed that the bookmarks don't get wiped on a page refresh - pretty cool, right? This was made possible by a package called [Recoil Persist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/recoil-persist) which gives you the option to save your recoil atoms to `localStorage`. 

**Navigation-bar Pages**

This was quite easy to do, after I had setup the grid-layout. Once I'd done the first page, doing the rest was just a matter of copy & paste whilst changing the filter parameters. Now all that's left to do is the search functionality and this project will be finished with!
