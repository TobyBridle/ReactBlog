I needed something that, though giving me more experience &#x26; confidence in React,\nwould not consume all of my freetime (it was the Christmas holidays - time for relaxing). I went through my Figma and found a design\nfor a college project (BHASVIC Magazine) that I hadn't ended up using. It matched my criteria, and was easy enough to code.</p>\n<h1>A Timeline of Development</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Though this project was not <strong>too</strong> time consuming, I still had quite a few hiccups.\nFor the first few hours, development was going swimmingly. The theme switching was working - and the components such as the <code>Navbar</code> and <code>PageMeta</code> were coming along nicely; however, I encountered a problem that I had overlooked: hosting. At the time, I was using <code>create-react-app</code> to bundle my code. It did not provide the features that I needed. This is when I looked to <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">Gatsby</a>. I ported all of my Components from my <code>create-react-app</code> project over to Gatsby - also switching from <a href=\"https://redux.js.org/\">Redux</a> to <a href=\"https://recoiljs.org/\">Recoil</a>. I found Recoil much simpler to use, and it turns out it's also much faster (<code>O(1)</code> rather than O(n)`).</p>\n</blockquote>"
