~~Maybe, this README will be edited in the future and I'll continue it. Until then, consider this repo as inactive.~~
<br>
Though not too high on my list of projects to continue in 2023, this is no longer
completely inactive as I have managed to figure out where I had gone wrong before.

~~**The WIP state that it was in before the incident can still be found [here](https://blog.bridle.ml/explore/)**~~

This project is no longer hosted; however, can still be run locally just fine.
To view a preview of the site, run:

```bash
$ yarn install
