# Announcement!
Sadly, due to some issues regarding the original system this was developed on, this repo is no longer going to be developed. There were only a few things that I needed to complete (as shown below) before I could boast the site on my portfolio; however, the setback caused by losing a large amount of files has, from what I can see at the moment (14/07/22), placed me in a position where the time consumption of restoring it to the original state is not worth the total gain.

Maybe, this README will be edited in the future and I'll continue it. Until then, consider this repo as inactive.

**The WIP state that it was in before the incident can still be found [here](https://blog.bridle.ml/explore/)**
